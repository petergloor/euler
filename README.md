# euler
My solutions for the Euler Project written in Go (golang)

##### Note
The project *clocksequence* is on hold.

It refers to the Project Euler Problem #506.

However, currently it makes not much sense to try to solve the problem as it obviousely needs something like the math/big package. The current solution works for sequences up to S(49) only.
  However, I'll keep the project for further investigations.
