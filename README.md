# euler
My solutions for the Euler Project written in Go (golang)

#### Note
The project **problem_506** *(clocksequence)* is on hold.

Currently it makes not much sense to try to solve the problem as it involves to deal with big numbers. To handle the data it probably  needs the package math/big. The current solution works for sequences up to S(49) only. However, I'll keep the project for further investigations.
