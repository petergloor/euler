 Problem 506

 Solved by 522; Difficulty rating: 30%
 Consider the infinite repeating sequence of digits:
 1234321234321234321...

 Amazingly, you can break this sequence of digits into a sequence of
 integers such that the sum of the digits in the n'th value is n.

 The sequence goes as follows:
 1, 2, 3, 4, 32, 123, 43, 2123, 432, 1234, 32123, ...

 Let vn be the n'th value in this sequence.
 For example, v2 = 2, v5 = 32 and v11 = 32123.

 Let S(n) be v1 + v2 + ... + vn.
 For example, S(11) = 36120, and S(1000) mod 123454321 = 18232686.

 Find S(1014) mod 123454321.
